##  Objective

After participating in one too many incident response activities, PicoSecure has decided to conduct a threat simulation and detection engineering engagement to bolster its malware detection capabilities. You have been assigned to work with an external penetration tester in an iterative purple-team scenario. The tester will be attempting to execute malware samples on a simulated internal user workstation. At the same time, you will need to configure PicoSecure's security tools to detect and prevent the malware from executing.

Following the Pyramid of Pain's ascending priority of indicators, your objective is to increase the simulated adversaries' cost of operations and chase them away for good. Each level of the pyramid allows you to detect and prevent various indicators of attack.

Room Prerequisites

Completing the preceding rooms in the Cyber Defence Frameworks module will be beneficial before venturing into this challenge. Specifically, the following:

The Pyramid of Pain

After reading the e-mail I sent, I went to the malware sandbox to analyze the sample1.exe file that was sent to me. After studying it, I saw the behavior analysis Report about this malicious file. I then copied the hash of this file and brought it to the manage hashes section, where I entered the hash value to be blocked to ensure that it is stopped the next time this file is transmitted through e-mail.
